# babyML
BabyML is a no-code ML platform I built as a personal project. 

It’s built with Next.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend, and deployed using Vercel, Render, and Upstash. For the machine learning tasks, I’ve integrated Microsoft’s FLAML library, which is a simple and efficient AutoML tool that takes care of everything.

(Since the backend instance occasionally spins down, there might be small delays in website responsiveness)
