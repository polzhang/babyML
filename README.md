# babyML
babyML is a simple no-code ML platform I built as a personal project. 

The project is built with Next.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend. It’s deployed using Vercel, Render, and Upstash to ensure everything runs smoothly. It uses Microsoft’s FLAML library, a simple and efficient AutoML tool, to handle machine learning tasks.
