# babyML
BabyML is a no-code ML platform I built as a personal project. 

Itâ€™s built with Next.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend, and deployed using Vercel, Render, and Upstash.

(Since the backend instance occasionally spins down, there might be small delays in website responsiveness)
