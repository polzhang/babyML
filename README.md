# babyML
BabyML is a no-code ML platform I built as a personal project.
It utlises FLAML, an AutoML library to handle machine learning tasks. 
Read more here: [https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Getting-Started/](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/)

Itâ€™s built with Next.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend, and deployed using Vercel, Render, and Upstash. 

Try it here: https://baby-ml.vercel.app/
(Since the backend instance occasionally spins down, there might be small delays in website responsiveness)
